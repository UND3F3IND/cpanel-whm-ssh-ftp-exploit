# cpanel-whm-ssh-ftp-exploit
This is a Python script that appears to be related to web exploitation, particularly targeting cPanel, WHM (Web Host Manager), SSH (Secure Shell), and FTP (File Transfer Protocol).

The script imports various Python libraries such as paramiko, requests, ftplib, subprocess, and urllib2, among others, to perform different types of exploits.

It defines several functions, including:

cpanel: Checks if a given cPanel login is valid.
whm: Checks if a given WHM login is valid.
l3gion: Performs SSH connection attempts using a given IP address, username, and password.
checkssh: Checks if an SSH connection is successful.
gas: Attempts to log in to an FTP server using a given host, username, and password.
The script also includes some helper functions and utilities, such as banner for displaying a banner, bagian, bagian2, bagian3, and bagian4 for handling different parts of the exploits, and LaravelBot as the main entry point for the script.
